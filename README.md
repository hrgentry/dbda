# About 

This R package collects the R code [distributed](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/software-installation) within the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (DBDA) by John K. Kruschke. 

The idea of the `dbda` package is to make the life of the DBDA's reader a little bit easier. That reader who also learns things by running the R scripts.

The main usage of this package is to re-run the R scripts created by John K. Kruschke like an R package. A particular case is doing the exercises at the end of each chapter of the book.
